## Introduction
Attempt to create a python script that monitors a telegram bot URL and replies to commands for adding/removing karma.

Check more information about [Telegram Bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots/).

## Important
- The bot will need to have access to all of your messages in order to find the words with "++" or "--"

## Notes
- On first execution it will create database and start filling values

## Test
- I've a copy running on <openshift.redhat.com> at <http://stampy-iranzo.rhcloud.com/> with the name `redken_bot`. Invite it to your channels if you want to give it a try or click <https://telegram.me/redken_bot>.

## Usage
- word++ to add karma
- word-- to remove karma
