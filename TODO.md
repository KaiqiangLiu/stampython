- Consider moving to webhook for async operation
    - Now it runs in daemon mode, polling every 10 seconds
- Implement comands for list top rank (rank)
- Implement command for search for rank (srank)
- Implement command to query rank (rank word)
- Implement showing drawing or sticker for X00, X000, X0000 ranks
- Initial load of karma points from older bot (possible separate script)
    - Initial graphics in ascii from irc stampy
- Consider having separate karma per group-id to have privacy on the topics discussed on each one (no leaks because of karma)
